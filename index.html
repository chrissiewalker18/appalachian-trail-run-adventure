		<h2>Our Appalachian Adventure</h2>
		
		<h4>What Are We Doing?</h4>

		<p class="intro">
			We have put together a group of 8 runners for a team relay race. It is a 
			non-stop relay through the Appalachian mountains. We will spend the weekend 
			running and camping near Big Bear Lake, West Virginia. Together our team will 
			run 120 miles over the course of 24 hours. We realize we're crazy, but doesn't 
			every great adventure start with a slightly insane group of people doing 
			something mildly ridiculous?
		</p>
		
		<h4>What's The Plan?</h4>
		
		<p class="intro">
			Leaving Thursday, we will caravan down to Big Bear. The team will scout out 
			the best available campsite and settle in. Friday morning we check in for the 
			race and prepare before our pre-assigned start time. Over the course of Friday 
			and Saturday, the team will take turns running legs of the race. While not 
			runnings, the rest of the team will be hanging out around the campfire in base 
			camp. If everything goes according to plan, we will finish the race Saturday 
			afternoon sometime. We will spend our last night celebrating our exciting 
			accomplishment before heading back to the real world on Sunday.
		</p>
		
		<h4>The History of Our Team</h4>
		
		<p class="intro">
			Chrissie stumbled upon this trail run while browsing for her next crazy 
			adventure. She began searching for others just as crazy as her. This led her 
			to Molly who was immediately enthusiastic. Chrissie and Molly promptly ran to 
			Danielle's desk (they all work together). She too agreed this was one 
			event they just couldn't miss. And thus began the hunt for teammates! Sean, 
			being another co-worker, was the next to join. Chrissie then spoke to her 
			friend Christa. Danielle reached out to Sue and VJ. The team was almost complete! 
			However, the last spot proved to be the hardest. Endless people have been asked. 
			Those available weren't crazy enough and those crazy enough weren't available. 
			Stay tuned for more on "The Search for the 8th".
