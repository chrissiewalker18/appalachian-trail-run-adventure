		<h2>Check Out the Trails</h2>

		<p>
			The race has three different trails each of varying difficulty. All of the 
			trails begins and ends at the central camping village. The race will be run 
			relay style in 24 legs. Each of the 8 runners on a team will run every one of 
			the trails once. Runners must remain in the same order throughout the entire 
			race. The team runs the loops in order collectively, but each runner will have 
			a different pattern. The trails will total 15.7 miles for each runner.
		</p>

		<h3>The Green Trail: 3.6 Miles</h3>
		
		<p>
			A winding and gently rolling trail, the green will be the easiest and shortest 
			loop. Runners will enjoy scenic views as they jog along this lone trail around 
			a small creek. Beware - it can be rocky and ends in a small climb.
		</p>
		
		<h3>The Yellow Trail: 6.2 Miles</h3>
		
		<p>
			Runners will be amazed by the views along this traditional Appalachian wooded 
			trail. The trail will take you through a large grove of towering pine trees. 
			Enjoy the run over soft pine needles while taking in the landscape views. 
			Beware - there is a steep drop around near the middle of the trail. The final 
			two miles wind along the mountains.
		</p>
		
		<h3>The Red Trail: 6.2 Miles</h3>
		
		<p>
			While the red loop is the most difficult of the race, it is also a favorite 
			of many runners. The trail weaves through tall ferns, twists over 
			bolders, runs along a stream, and crosses over a swamp. All of the thrills 
			and challenges of Appalachian running will be experienced in this trail.
